    <section class="about">
        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>This Discord bot was created to help manage and improve communication within the UMBC Tabletop Gaming Discord server. It was built to automate repetitive tasks, share announcements, organize events, and provide useful utilities that make it easier for members to stay engaged and informed. Whether it's sending reminders, managing roles, or providing quick access to club resources, the bot is designed to make the club's online space more interactive and efficient for both members and administrators.</p>

    <section class="commands">
        <h1>Bot Commands</h1>
        <h2>/add-upcoming-events</h2>
        
        <p>
            Allows people with the "Club Officer" role to add events to be shown to the public. Adding events is done by entering the name of the event and the date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Events with past dates are automatically removed.
        </p>

        <h2>/club-games</h2>
        <p>
            Displays a list of board games owned by the club that can be brought and played during meetings.
        </p>

        <h2>/list-member-games</h2>
        <p>
            Retrieves a list of board games owned by a specific member. The user enters the member's Discord username, and if that member has set up their collection using the /set-owned-games command, their list will be displayed.
        </p>

        <h2>/price-is-right</h2>
        <p>
            Shows an image of a game, and users guess the MSRP price by entering the command again with a price guess. If a user guesses before a game is started, they will receive a warning. Games end after 1 minute if no guesses are made. Guesses within 5% of the actual price are considered correct.
        </p>

        <h2>/random-fact</h2>
        <p>
            Returns a random fact from a curated backend list.
        </p>

        <h2>/remove-upcoming-event</h2>
        <p>
            Allows "Club Officer" role members to remove events from the upcoming events list by entering the event name.
        </p>

        <h2>/rock-paper-scissors</h2>
        <p>
            Play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the bot. The botâ€™s choice is based on weighted probabilities. Enter your choice when using the command.
        </p>

        <h2>/roll-dice</h2>
        <p>
            Rolls multiple dice. The user specifies the number of dice and how many sides each die has. Displays all roll results and the frequency of each outcome.
        </p>

        <h2>/roll-die</h2>
        <p>
            Rolls a single die. The user specifies how many sides the die should have and receives one random result.
        </p>

        <h2>/search-board-game</h2>
        <p>
            Searches for a board game by name and provides information including year of release, popularity rank on BoardGameGeek, number of ratings, average rating, playtime length, and complexity score.
        </p>

        <h2>/server</h2>
        <p>
            Displays the current number of members in the server.
        </p>

        <h2>/set-owned-games</h2>
        <p>
            Allows users to link their BoardGameGeek (BGG) account by entering their BGG username. This enables others to view the games they own via the /list-member-games command. The BGG username and Discord ID are saved for future searches.
        </p>

        <h2>/song-of-the-day</h2>
        <p>
            Lets "Club Officer" role members add a "Song of the Day." The user enters a date (YYYY-MM-DD) and either a song name or a link (YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music). The bot posts the song in a "song-of-the-day" channel at 5:17 UTC. If a date already has a song, new entries overwrite the previous one.
        </p>

        <h2>/upcoming-events</h2>
        <p>
            Lists all upcoming events sorted by date.
        </p>

        <h2>/user-most-played</h2>
        <p>
            Displays a list of a user's most played board games if they have linked their BoardGameGeek account using the /set-owned-games command.
