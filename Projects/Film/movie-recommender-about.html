        <h1>About Movie Recommender</h1>
        <p>Movie Recommender was a website I did for my CMSC 447 class at UMBC. This project was done in collaboration with two other classmates, Alex Cragg and William Brooks. The purpose of the website was for users to search for a movie and get movie recommendations based on the searched movie. For the project, we used The Movie Database (TMDB) API to get all information relating to movies.<br><br>Searching for a movie can be done three ways: the first way is by typing in the title or partial title of a movie which will result in movies that contain the title showing up, the second way is getting a random movie that falls within a certain popularity rank, and the last way is by genre which are ordered by current populairty.<br><br>The website was designed to be easy to use and navigate through with a way to go to a previous page or to the home page whenever the user wants to by being at the top fo the current page they are on. This allows users to never feel confuse and aids in the navigation process.<br><br>There is also a dark mode that the user can tongle at the bottom of each page if the user preferes having a darker background.<br><br>There are some formatting issues when viewed on a smaller screen or in a minimized view. When we were programming the website, we had desktop as the primary focus of the development.<br></p>
