        <h1>About Spades</h1>
        <p>Spades is a classic trick-taking card game played with four players in teams of two. The game uses a standard 52-card deck, and the objective is to accurately bid on the number of tricks your team will take in each round while strategically playing cards to outmaneuver your opponents.</p>
    
        <h1>How to Play</h1>
        <p>The game consists of multiple rounds, with players taking turns playing one card per trick. The player with the highest-ranking card in the leading suit wins the trick unless a spade is played, as spades are the trump suit.</p>
        <p>Each player is dealt 13 cards from a shuffled deck. Players must bid on the number of tricks they expect to take, with teams combining their bids. The player with the 2 of clubs starts the first trick.</p>
        <p>The first player of each trick must follow suit if possible. If a player cannot follow suit, they may play any card, including a spade. Spades cannot be led until they have been "broken" (played in a trick where a player couldn't follow suit). The winner of each trick leads the next one.</p>
        <p>If a team meets or exceeds their bid, they score 10 points per trick bid plus 1 point for each additional trick. If a team fails to meet their bid, they lose 10 points per trick bid. Accumulating 10 extra tricks results in a 100-point penalty. The game continues until a team reaches 500 points.</p>
    
        <h1>Development Status</h1>
        <p>This project is still under development, with upcoming features including statistic tracking to monitor wins, losses, and performance over time, as well as online multiplayer functionality to play with friends or other players worldwide.</p>
